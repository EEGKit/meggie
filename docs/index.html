  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  Meggie is an open source software for running MEG and EEG analysis with easy-to-use graphical user interface. It is written in Python and uses MNE-python library under the hood to do heavy lifting. The project was started in XXXX in University of Jyväskylä and has been used in-house since the early days, but has been released to public only lately. <br><br>

  There are other software that can be used for M/EEG analysis. Most popular at the time of writing seem to be Fieldtrip based on Matlab language, and MNE-python based on python language. Both of these software have a great variety of analysis methods to offer and are most often used by user writing a python/matlab script in which the functions provided by the packages are called. This way user can give the raw data measured with M/EEG devices to the script, script runs a series of analysis steps, perhaps including preprocessing, epoching, averaging, and plotting, and then outputs the result. <br> <br>

  This is not always easy for researcher not familiar with programming. To mention one other matlab package, EEGLab, which made the usage easy. Community moving the python, only EEG? <br><br>

  There is also mnelab which is also based on mne-python. Meggie is not designed to compete with mnelab, which seems to work a bit like ...elekta?, that is, it is great for inspecting data for single subjects, but not necessarily for running multiple subsequent steps of analysis in a experiment with tens of subjects. <br><br>

  And that is what Meggie is designed to do in very easy-to-use way, with great extendability as in EEGLab.

  <h2>Features</h2>
  Some of the basic features of Meggie are explained below.
  <div id="overview">
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    Overview.. here put a picture with red rectangles and med eeg subjects loaded.
  </div>
  <div id="analysis">
    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    Data import, preprocessing (all steps), spectrums, epochs, evoked, TFR's, output as plots and csv's. Pictures?
  </div>
  <div id="batching">
    <h3>Batching</h3>
    Most of the actions (that do not need require supervision) can be run simulatenously for multiple subjects.
  </div>
  <div id="plugins">
    <h3>Plugins</h3>
    The core functionality is carefully designed and tested. However, it there are great avenues to where extend. Meggie includes a very simple to use plugin architecture.
