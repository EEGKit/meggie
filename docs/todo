  (- mne_wrapper make sure that it is safe, apparently pkgutil has bug (https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/11956) -)
  (- group info's should only include subjects that finished without error, batching widget can probably give the info)
  (- tse should not look like a spider)
  (- saving plots should always be possible, though at least the raw plot removes toolbar for more space which can make sense)
