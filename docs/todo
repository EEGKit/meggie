TODO:

features:
- whole new cluster based statistics world
- mixed data topomaps poorly supported (eeg isnt plotted always when possible).
- set tabstops properly
- set channel groups for experiment; channel groups can then be used in many places with eeg also. (for eeg default is all channels)
- bad channel interpolation
- add more ui_logger logs, they are useful e.g via "grep Meggie meggie.log"
- unified ssp projection utility
- plot accuracy as preference
- add simple trigger filtering (only triggers followed by something), and delay
- maybe a mock subject possibility combined with epoch or evoked or event import
- unify names of accept-buttons
- we need tests
- check that "all" functionalities are wrapped in try except
