TODO:

- should do manual for meggie
- refactoring:
 * get rid of the caller by
  - keeping the state inside Experiment-object that is intialized in MainWindow
  - moving methods of caller to other python files as functions
  - look into structure of mainWindowUi
    * separate different tabs to different files?
    * epochs batching widget code maybe should not lie there globally
 * check proper style with pylint
- we need tests
- have to check what happens if mne and freesurfer cant be found in the paths

bugs:
- in ica, does not use layout file for topography
- there is a bug in epoch collection creation with batching widget that can hide collections from the main window
- experiment-saving will not scale well, as saving is loading every evoked object from every subject temporarily
- fix EEG projections / Ocular projections name mixup
- when creating the projection vectors from EOG, some of the data might unnecessarily be rejected

features:
- maybe a mock subject possibility combined with epoch or evoked import
- open experiment also by specifying the exp file
- ica done? doing ica transform in the source analysis part?
- batch for saving spectrums ( there is a branch starting this )
- average spectrums over subjects
- maybe dont close dialogs with accept-button
- unify names of accept-buttons
- allow defining of colors for spectrums
- average groups for epoch-based spetrums also
- if possible, similar stats/seletion things as for epochs, for spectrums also
