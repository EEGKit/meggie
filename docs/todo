  - And check that figure saving works and dpi to preferences (yes it cropped very weirdly did not it), and think about lower()
  - For user, info boxes are very important
  - unify dialog names: "Meggie - " or without
  (- Remove more of those logged messages)
  (- are you sure to remove to all deletes.)
  (- should ensure that mainwindow and dialogs have tryexcepts, everything else should be fine as dynamic.py catches everything but handlers, and handlers already have tryexcepts)
  (- but bad channel selection should be more clear again, and should ensure unified appreciation of bad channels, both when creating and when plotting/saving. currently with evoked, bad channels are kept until saving or plotting. with specturm, bad channels are removed on creation. with tfrs.., tfr_morlet excludes bad channels)
  (- take baseline away from tse computation and add toplotting)
