TODO:

- should do manual for meggie

- refactoring:
 * main window tabs to separate files
 * check proper style with pylint
- we need tests
- i totally need to check all the TFR code and spectrums in the spectral analysis tab

bugs:
- experiment-saving will not scale well, as saving is loading every evoked object from every subject temporarily
- when creating the projection vectors from EOG, some of the data might unnecessarily be rejected

features:
- njobs-story
- update meter and cancel button for batch
- maybe a mock subject possibility combined with epoch or evoked import
- open experiment also by specifying the exp file
- ica done? doing ica transform in the source analysis part?
- batch for saving spectrums ( there is a branch starting this )
- average spectrums over subjects
- average tfrs over subjects
- maybe dont close dialogs with accept-button, and change cancel-button name to close, and always print a text when job is finished, or maybe a popup
- unify names of accept-buttons
- allow defining of colors for spectrums
- average groups for epoch-based spetrums also
- event import
