  (- mne_wrapper make sure that it is safe, apparently pkgutil has bug (https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/11956) -)
  (- group info's should only include subjects that finished without error, batching widget can probably give the info)
  (- tse should not look like a spider, so always compute longer, but save tmin and tmax that are used to crop?)
  (- tfr topographies more vivid, issue)
  (- add tests, should try to at least figure out a strategy)
  (- add statistics, issue)
  (- improve datasets import possibilities, issue)
  (- event delay, min duration, 2 issues)
  (- add and improve ui_logger logs, issue)
