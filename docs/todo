TODO:

- refactoring:
 * check proper style with pylint
 * remove active_subject-references from code_meggie analysis-sections (pass by parameter)
- we need tests

bugs:
- if doing source analysis for eeg, must ensure that average reference is used
- experiment-saving will not scale well, as saving is loading every evoked object from every subject temporarily
- mixed data topomaps poorly supported (eeg isnt plotted when possible).
- check that "all" functionalities are wrapped in try except
- unify names of accept-buttons

features:
- multi-groupaverage (maybe some dialog from group average, where can set number for each subject)
- add batch for tfrs
- channel groups for visualization and saving in tfrs. 
- set tabstops properly
- set channel groups for experiment; channel groups can then be used in many places with eeg also. (for eeg default is all channels)
- bad channel interpolation
- add more ui_logger logs, they are useful e.g via "grep Meggie meggie.log"
- in logging window, checkboxes for debug and info
- add way to get the list of channels and a picture of channel averages, maybe some interactive thingy
- unified ssp projection utility
- plot accuracy as preference
- add delay to triggers
- add simple trigger filtering (only triggers followed by something)
- maybe a mock subject possibility combined with epoch or evoked or event import
- allow defining of colors for spectrums
