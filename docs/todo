done:
  (- save_content (at least for evoked) should print the real error message too)
  (- mne_wrapper make sure that it is safe, apparently pkgutil has bug (https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/11956) -)
  (- group info's should only include subjects that finished without error, now prints warnings)
  (- event delay, min duration, 2 issues)
  (- add and improve ui_logger logs, issue)
  (- tfr topographies more vivid, issue)
  (- tse should not look like a spider, so always compute longer, but save tmin and tmax that are used to crop?, not doing)
  (- improve datasets import possibilities, should test with few, issue)

next:
  (- create branch for old stc code?)
  (- add tests, should try to at least figure out a strategy)
