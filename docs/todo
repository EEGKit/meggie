TODO:

- refactoring:
 * all main window tabs to separate files
 * check proper style with pylint
 * combine general/fileManager.py and utils/files.py
 * remove active_subject-references from code_meggie analysis-sections (pass by parameter)
- we need tests
- should do manual for meggie

bugs:
- ssp default amount of vectors
- experiment-saving will not scale well, as saving is loading every evoked object from every subject temporarily
- meggie allows to create a new experiment over existing experiment,
- powerspectrum dialog name field size

features:
- ica applied checkbox
- add way to get the list of channels and a picture of channel averages, maybe some interactive thingy
- add throbber to bad channel dialog
- plot accuracy as preference
- tfr save data and tfr multiple conditions (plotting is done by plotting multiple plots)
- unify EEG and EOG projections (EEG is EOG with channel selection)
- add delay to triggers
- add simple trigger filtering (only triggers followed by something)
- log parsing, subject specific
- more automated ICA
- njobs-story
- update meter and cancel button for batch
- maybe a mock subject possibility combined with epoch or evoked import
- open experiment also by specifying the exp file
- maybe dont close dialogs with accept-button, and change cancel-button name to close, and always print a text when job is finished, or maybe a popup
- unify names of accept-buttons
- allow defining of colors for spectrums
- event import
