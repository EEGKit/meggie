TODO:

- refactoring:
 * all main window tabs to separate files
 * check proper style with pylint
 * combine general/fileManager.py and utils/files.py
 * remove active_subject-references from code_meggie analysis-sections (pass by parameter)
- we need tests
- should do manual for meggie

bugs:
- eeg-data eeg reference (not added as projection in 0.17.0)
- ssp default amount of vectors
- experiment-saving will not scale well, as saving is loading every evoked object from every subject temporarily
- meggie allows to create a new experiment over existing experiment,
- powerspectrum dialog name field size
- mixed data poorly supported (eeg isnt plotted when possible). should make it so that layout is only used for eeg and always when possible eeg uses that separately from meg.

features:
- bad channels in spectrums should be saved to the spectrum object, not taken from the raw
- set own baselines for epochs
- eeg referencing gui, combining etc fun stuff. to import! special options?
- add more ui_logger logs, they are useful e.g via "grep Meggie meggie.log"
- ica applied checkbox
- add way to get the list of channels and a picture of channel averages, maybe some interactive thingy
- add throbber to bad channel dialog
- plot accuracy as preference
- tfr save data and tfr multiple conditions (plotting is done by plotting multiple plots)
- unify EEG and EOG projections (EEG is EOG with channel selection)
- add delay to triggers
- add simple trigger filtering (only triggers followed by something)
- log parsing, subject specific
- more automated ICA
- njobs-story
- update meter and cancel button for batch
- maybe a mock subject possibility combined with epoch or evoked import
- open experiment also by specifying the exp file
- maybe dont close dialogs with accept-button, and change cancel-button name to close, and always print a text when job is finished, or maybe a popup
- unify names of accept-buttons
- allow defining of colors for spectrums
- event import
