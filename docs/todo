  (- should implement some tab as a plugin as an example. maybe the source analysis or maybe hmm?-)
  (- should make save so that subject name, channel etc are in the different columns)
  (- group info's should only include subjects that finished without error, batching widget can probably give the info)
  (- for tfr's frequency info, cycles info, for epochs, add also epoch counts)
  (- eeg support so that on every plot both meg and eeg are plotted, maybe layouts should be set by channel type. so next big update will be groups and channel types)
  (- Remove more of those logged messages)
  (- are you sure to remove to all deletes.)
  (- should ensure that mainwindow and dialogs have tryexcepts, everything else should be fine as dynamic.py catches everything but handlers, and handlers already have tryexcepts)
  (- but bad channel selection should be more clear again, and should ensure unified appreciation of bad channels, both when creating and when plotting/saving. currently with evoked, bad channels are kept until saving or plotting. with specturm, bad channels are removed on creation. with tfrs.., tfr_morlet excludes bad channels)
