*** Muokkaa kun testattu Canopyn asennus


REQUIRED LIBRARIES for running Meggie:

1. Python

Meggie is written with Python 2.7.3, included in Enthought Python Distribution (EPD) version 7.3-2. It has also been tested with Python 2.7.3 included in Fedora 16.

Meggie has not been tested with Python 3. If you're running Meggie in a modern distribution and get weird errors, please make sure you're not using Python 3 to execute it.


2. Python libraries for scientific computing

Meggie requires the following Python extra libraries:

- numpy (tested with version 1.6.2 included in EPD ***and Fedora 16 64bit)
- scipy (tested with version 0.10.1 included in EPD ***Fedora 16 has 0.9.0-2, test***)

Reasonably modern Linux distributions should have the required or later versions in their repositories. These versions may work, or they may trigger apocalyptic events, including unwanted pregnancies in domestic animals.


3. MNE

Meggie has been tested with MNE version 2.7.0-3106-Linux-x86_64 from http://martinos.org/mne/. 


4. MNE-python

Meggie uses MNE-python for various functionalities, including computing SSP projections for removal of ECG and EOG artifacts. The sofware has been tested with mne-python version from git (fetched February 13th 2013). See installation instructions at 

http://martinos.org/mne/getting_started.html which refers to

5. PyQt

Meggie has been tested with PyQt version 4.8.6 (from Fedora 16) and version 4.9.6 from PyQt source. For feats required for compile the latter, see http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyqt/files/PyQt4/ . Distribution specific packages should normally work well, though.
